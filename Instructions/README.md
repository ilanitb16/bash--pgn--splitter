# Operation-Systems-Exercises

Welcome to the **Operation Systems Exercises** repository for the **Semester B 2024**. This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to enhance your understanding and practical skills in operating systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different exercise. Some exercises are further divided into multiple parts, with each part detailed in separate Markdown files (e.g., `Part1.md`, `Part2.md`, etc.).

### Directory Layout

- **Exercise 1**
  - `Part1.md`
  - `Part2.md`
  - `solution.c`
  - ...

- **Exercise 2**
  - `Part1.md`
  - `solution.sh`
  - ...

- **Exercise 3**
  - `instructions.md`
  - `Makefile`
  - ...

## Instructions

1. **Exercise Directories**: Each exercise is located in its own directory. Navigate to the respective directory to find the exercise details.
2. **Markdown Files**: Instructions for each exercise and its parts are provided in Markdown files (`.md`). These files will guide you through the tasks you need to complete.
3. **Submission**: Ensure you submit all the files mentioned in the instructions. This may include code files, scripts, configuration files, etc.

### Example of Submission Instructions

For an exercise with multiple parts, you might find:

- `Part1.md` with instructions to write a specific program.
- `Part2.md` with instructions for another task related to the exercise.
- Additional files required to complete the tasks.

### Important Notes

- **Read Carefully**: Make sure to read the instructions in the `.md` files thoroughly before starting each exercise.
- **Follow Submission Guidelines**: Submit all required files as specified in the instructions to avoid any penalties.

We hope these exercises help you develop a strong foundation in operating systems. Happy coding!
